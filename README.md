# Robot_Vehicle

## Description
The purpose of this project was to develop a prototype of a Bluetooth-controlled robot machine. However, the machine incorporates certain limitations that take precedence over the commands received via Bluetooth, ensuring the safety of operation. These limitations primarily involve two aspects. Firstly, the machine's movement is constrained within a specific area, demarcated by a black bar on the ground. Secondly, the machine must navigate around various obstacles, such as walls or living creatures.

To adhere to these restrictions, the robot car is programmed to react accordingly. If it detects an obstacle or approaches the boundaries of the designated area, it will automatically move in reverse to avoid collisions or exceeding its permitted range of movement.
